; this was my first approach to drawing pixels with random colors at random positions on the screen until the whole screen is filled
; while never filling the same position more than once.
; the way this works is that filled positions are recorded in a buffer and aren't drawn to again by iterating through the entire
; buffer every time and checking whether the new position is in the buffer
; which makes this approach very slow in the common case because no buffer is required in the first place, see fast_random_color_fill.asm.
; this has a time complexity of O(âˆž).

; NB: BEQ branches when zero flag is 1 and BNE branches when zero flag is 0.

; NOTE: this approach has some bugs and the out of bounds checks are not accurate

; this will give us a random byte
define random $fe

; the position on the screen to fill
define positionL $00
define positionH $01

; the buffer to record filled positions in
define bufferL $02
define bufferH $03

; the buffer index to check filled positions with
define bufferIndexL $04
define bufferIndexH $05
